			This Website was created by Ryan Dreher as part of a homework assignment for Web Design (Comp 20) at Tufts University. This assignment was incredibly fun to create, and using the css styling to create interesting formats was fun. It was difficult, though, and it came with a number of problems. For instance, aligning the Home, Contact, and About tabs at the top of the page was incredibly tedious for some reason. This was fixed by changing the "div" tag to an "a" tag, as there were two div tags, causing the new line.
