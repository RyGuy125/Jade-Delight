If you had an extra two weeks for this project, what feature(s) would you add.

Well, I certainly would add more of what is required for this assignment. However, time constraints and confusion led to its current state. Given more time, I would also try to incorporate some photos for the dishes that are available. Also, incorporating good CSS for visuals and usability would be nice.
