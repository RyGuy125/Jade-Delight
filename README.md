What is your opinion of JavaScript?

Well, as with starting any new language, the first few pass-throughs are always rough. I had a particularly hard time in
the beginning getting used to the object oriented class and class members such as document.getElementById. Eventually though
it became easier to manage and was second nature by the end of this assignment. Overall, coding is always fun and it was great
to start with a new language!
